# Simple TypeScript Script Example

This example shows how to use [Prisma Client](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/prisma-client-js/api.md) in combination with [Prisma Migrate](https://github.com/prisma/migrate). Prisma Client is used in a **simple TypeScript script** to read and write data in a database. Prisma Migrate is used to perform database schema migrations.

cd prisma-examples/experimental/typescript/script
__INLINE(../../_setup-2.md)__

### 4. Run the script

Execute the script with this command: 

```
npm run dev
```

> **Note**: You need to execute the command in a new terminal window/tab, since the development mode is taking up your currrent terminal session.
