npm install
```

### 2. Run Prisma's development mode

<Details><Summary>Learn more about the development mode</Summary>

Prisma's [development mode](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/development-mode.md) watches your [Prisma schema](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/prisma-schema-file.md) on the file system. Whenever there's a change in the schema, the Prisma Framework CLI performs two major tasks in the background:

- map the Prisma schema to your database schema (i.e., perform a schema migration in the database) 
- regenerate the Photon.js database client based on the new Prisma schema

It also runs a web server to host [Prisma Studio](https://github.com/prisma/studio), typically at [`http://localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555).

In this case, the command also creates a new [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) file at `./prisma/dev.db` since that didn't exist in the project yet.

</Details>

Start the development mode with the following command:

```
npx prisma2 dev
```

> **Note**: You're using [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx) to run the Prisma Framework CLI that's listed as a development dependency in [`package.json`](./package.json). Alternatively, you can install the CLI globally using `npm install -g prisma2`. When using Yarn, you can run: `yarn prisma2 dev`.

You can now open [Prisma Studio](https://github.com/prisma/studio), open your browsers and navigate to the the URL displayed by the CLI output (typically at [`http://localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555)).

<Summary><b>Alternative: </b>Connect to your own database</Summary>

Prisma supports MySQL and PostgreSQL at the moment. If you would like to connect to your own database, you can do so by specifying a different data source in the [Prisma schema file](prisma/schema.prisma).

For a MySQL provider:
```
datasource mysql {
    provider = "mysql"
    url      = "mysql://johndoe:secret42@localhost:3306/mydatabase"
}
```

*OR*

For a PostgreSQL provider:
```
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:secret42@localhost:5432/mydatabase?schema=public"
}
```

> Note: In the above example connection strings, `johndoe` would be the username to your database, `secret42` the password, `mydatabase` the name of your database, and `public` the [PostgreSQL schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/ddl-schemas.html). 

Then to migrate your database, run:

```sh
npx prisma2 lift save --name 'init'
npx prisma2 lift up
```
