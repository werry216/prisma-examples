# GraphQL Apollo Server Example

> ⚠️ This example is currently broken due to the breaking changes in the [`preview020`](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/releases/tag/2.0.0-preview020) release. We are already in the process of fixing it, so it will be available very soon again.

This example shows how to implement a **GraphQL server with TypeScript** based on  [Prisma Client](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/prisma-client-js/api.md), [apollo-server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) and [GraphQL Nexus](https://nexus.js.org/).
