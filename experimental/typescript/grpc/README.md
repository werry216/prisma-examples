# gRPC Server Example

This example shows how to implement a **gRPC API with TypeScript** and [Prisma Client](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/prisma-client-js/api.md).

## How to use

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install Node dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/experimental/typescript/grpc
npm install
```

Note that this also generates Prisma Client JS into `node_modules/@prisma/client` via a `postinstall` hook of the `@prisma/client` package from your `package.json`.

### 2. Migrate your database schema

Perform an initial schema migration against your database using the following commands:

```
npx prisma migrate save --name 'init' --experimental
npx prisma migrate up --experimental
```

The first step will save the migration in the `prisma/migrations` folder. The second step will execute the migrations.

> **Note**: You're using [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx) to run Prisma 2 CLI that's listed as a development dependency in [`package.json`](./package.json). Alternatively, you can install the CLI globally using `npm install -g @prisma/cli`. When using Yarn, you can run: `yarn prisma dev`.

<Summary><b>Alternative: </b>Connect to your own database</Summary>

Prisma supports MySQL and PostgreSQL at the moment. If you would like to connect to your own database, you can do so by specifying a different data source in the [Prisma schema file](prisma/schema.prisma).

For a MySQL provider:

```prisma
datasource mysql {
    provider = "mysql"
    url      = "mysql://johndoe:secret42@localhost:3306/mydatabase"
}
```

*OR*

For a PostgreSQL provider:

```prisma
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:secret42@localhost:5432/mydatabase?schema=public"
}
```

> **Note**: In the above example connection strings, `johndoe` would be the username to your database, `secret42` the password, `mydatabase` the name of your database, and `public` the [PostgreSQL schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/ddl-schemas.html).

</Details>

### 3. Generate Prisma Client

Run the following command to generate your Prisma Client API:

```
npx prisma generate
```

This command updated the Prisma Client API in `node_modules/@prisma/client`.

### 4. Seed the database with test data

The `seed` script from `package.json` contains some code to seed the database with test data. Execute it with the following command:

```
npm run seed
```

### 5. Start the gRPC server

```
npm run dev
```

The server is now running on `0.0.0.0:50051`. 

## Using the gRPC API

To use the gRPC API, you need a gRPC client. We provide several client scripts inside the [`./client`](./client) directory. Each script is named according to the operation it performs against the gRPC API (e.g. the [`feed.js`](./client/feed.js) script sends the [`Feed`](./service.proto#L7) operation). Each script can be invoked by running the corresponding NPM script defined in [`package.json`](./package.json), e.g. `npm run feed`.

In case you prefer a GUI client, we recommend [BloomRPC](https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc):

## Evolving the app with Prisma Migrate

Evolving the application typically requires four subsequent steps:

1. Update your Prisma schema
1. Save and migrate the database schema using Prisma Migrate
1. Generate Prisma Client to match the new schema with `prisma generate`
1. Use the updated Prisma Client in your application code

For the following example scenario, assume you want to add a "profile" feature to the app where users can create a single profile (1:1 relationship) and write a short bio about themselves and add a link to an image.

### 1. Update your Prisma schema

The first step would be to add a new model to the Prisma schema, e.g. called `Profile`. Prisma Migrate will create a corresponding table in the database.

To define a `1:1` relationship between `User` and `Profile`, you need to specify the relation field on both models as follows:

Add the Profile model with a `user` field of type `User`:

```prisma
model Profile {
  id       Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  user     User
  bio      String
  imageURL String?
}
```

Add the `Profile` relation field to the `User` model:

```diff
model User {
   id      Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
   email   String   @unique
   name    String?
   posts   Post[]
+  profile Profile?
}
```

### 2. Save and run the migration

#### Save the migration

To migrate the database schema you first need to save the migration as follows:

```
npx prisma migrate save --name 'add-profile' --experimental
```

The CLI will output the planned changes and save the migration files in `prisma/migrations/20200313000000-add-profile/` (they contain details about required migrations steps and SQL operations).

#### Run the migration

Now that the migration has been saved you can run the migration as follows:

```
npx prisma migrate up --experimental
```

This will actually perform the schema migration against the database.

Assuming everything went right, the CLI should output:

```
ðŸš€    Done with 1 migration
```

### 3. Generate Prisma Client

With the updated Prisma schema, you can now also update the Prisma Client API with the following command:

```
npx prisma generate
```

This command updated the Prisma Client API in `node_modules/@prisma/client`.
