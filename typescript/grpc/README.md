# gRPC Server Example

This example shows how to implement a **gRPC API with TypeScript** and [Photon.js](https://photonjs.prisma.io/).

## How to use

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Clone the `prisma2` branch of this repository:

```
git clone --single-branch --branch prisma2 git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git
```

Install Node dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/typescript/grpc
npm install
```

### 2. Run Prisma's development mode

<Details><Summary>Learn more about the development mode</Summary>

Prisma's [development mode](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/development-mode.md) watches your [Prisma schema](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2/blob/master/docs/prisma-schema-file.md) on the file system. Whenever there's a change in the schema, the Prisma Framework CLI performs two major tasks in the background:

- map the Prisma schema to your database schema (i.e., perform a schema migration in the database) 
- regenerate the Photon.js database client based on the new Prisma schema

It also runs a web server to host [Prisma Studio](https://github.com/prisma/studio), typically at [`http://localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555).

In this case, the command also creates a new [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) file at `./prisma/dev.db` since that didn't exist in the project yet.

</Details>

Start the development mode with the following command:

```
npx prisma2 dev
```

> **Note**: You're using [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx) to run the Prisma Framework CLI that's listed as a development dependency in [`package.json`](./package.json). Alternatively, you can install the CLI globally using `npm install -g prisma2`. When using Yarn, you can run: `yarn prisma2 dev`.

You can now open [Prisma Studio](https://github.com/prisma/studio), open your browsers and navigate to the the URL displayed by the CLI output (typically at [`http://localhost:5555`](http://localhost:5555)).

You can also use the [SQLite Browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to view and edit your data in the `./prisma/dev.db` file that was created when you ran `prisma2 dev`.

<Details>
<Summary><b>Alternative: </b>Connect to your own database</Summary>

Prisma supports MySQL and PostgreSQL at the moment. If you would like to connect to your own database, you can do so by specifying a different data source in the [Prisma schema file](prisma/schema.prisma).

For a MySQL provider:
```
datasource mysql {
    provider = "mysql"
    url      = "mysql://johndoe:secret42@localhost:3306/mydatabase"
}
```

*OR*

For a PostgreSQL provider:
```
datasource postgresql {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = "postgresql://johndoe:secret42@localhost:5432/mydatabase?schema=public"
}
```

> Note: In the above example connection strings, `johndoe` would be the username to your database, `secret42` the password, `mydatabase` the name of your database, and `public` the [PostgreSQL schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/ddl-schemas.html). 

Then to migrate your database, run:

```sh
npx prisma2 lift save --name 'init'
npx prisma2 lift up
```

</Details>

<!-- <Details>
<Summary><b>Alternative: </b>Use CLI commands for the schema migration and Photon.js generation</Summary> -->

Instead of using the development mode, you can also perform a schema migration using Lift, and generate Photon.js with a dedicated CLI command (learn more [below](#next-steps)).

<!-- </Details> -->

### 3. Seed the database with test data

The `seed` script from `package.json` contains some code to seed the database with test data. Execute it with the following command:

```
npm run seed
```


### 4. Start the gRPC server

```
npm run start
```

The server is now running on `0.0.0.0:50051`. 

### 5. Using the gRPC API

To use the gRPC API, you need a gRPC client. We provide several client scripts inside the [`./client`](./client) directory. Each script is named according to the operation it performs against the gRPC API (e.g. the [`feed.js`](./client/feed.js) script sends the [`Feed`](./service.proto#L7) operation). Each script can be invoked by running the corresponding NPM script defined in [`package.json`](./package.json), e.g. `npm run feed`.

In case you prefer a GUI client, we recommend [BloomRPC](https://github.com/uw-labs/bloomrpc):

## Next steps

### Use Lift to persist the schema migration

The migrations that were generated throughout the development mode are _development migrations_ that are thrown away once the desired schema has been found. In that case, you need to persist the schema using the `lift` subcommands.

To persist your schema migration with Lift, run:

```
npx prisma2 lift save --name 'init'
npx prisma2 lift up
```

The first command, `lift save`, stores a number of migration files on the file sytem with details about the migration (such as the required migration steps and SQL operations), this doesn't yet affect the database. It also deletes the old development migrations. The second command, `lift up`, actually performs the schema migration against the database.

### Generate Photon.js with the CLI

Sometimes, e.g. in CI/CD environments, it can be helpful to generate Photon.js with a CLI command. This can be done with the `prisma2 generate command`. If you want to run it in this project, you need to prepend `npx` again:

```
npx prisma2 generate
```
