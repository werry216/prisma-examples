# Fullstack Example with Next.js (REST API)

This example shows how to implement a **fullstack app in TypeScript with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** using [React](https://reactjs.org/) (frontend), [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client) (backend). It uses a SQLite database file with some initial dummy data which you can find at [`./prisma/dev.db`](./prisma/dev.db).

## How to use

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Download this example:

```
curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/latest | tar -xz --strip=2 prisma-examples-latest/typescript/rest-nextjs-api-routes
```

Install npm dependencies:
```
cd rest-nextjs-api-routes
npm install
```

Note that this also generates Prisma Client JS into `node_modules/@prisma/client` via a `postinstall` hook of the `@prisma/client` package from your `package.json`.

Clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prisma/prisma-examples.git --depth=1
```

Install npm dependencies:

```
cd prisma-examples/typescript/rest-nextjs-api-routes
npm install
```

### 2. Start the app

```
npm run dev
```

The app is now running, navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to explore its UI.

## Using the REST API

You can also access the REST API of the API server directly. It is running on the same host machine and port and can be accessed via the `/api` route (in this case that is `localhost:3000/api/`, so you can e.g. reach the API with [`localhost:3000/api/feed`](http://localhost:3000/api/feed)).

### `GET`

- `/api/post/:id`: Fetch a single post by its `id`
- `/api/feed`: Fetch all _published_ posts
- `/api/filterPosts?searchString={searchString}`: Filter posts by `title` or `content`

### `POST`

- `/api/post`: Create a new post
  - Body:
    - `title: String` (required): The title of the post
    - `content: String` (optional): The content of the post
    - `authorEmail: String` (required): The email of the user that creates the post
- `/api/user`: Create a new user
  - Body:
    - `email: String` (required): The email address of the user
    - `name: String` (optional): The name of the user

### `PUT`

- `/api/publish/:id`: Publish a post by its `id`

### `DELETE`
  
- `/api/post/:id`: Delete a post by its `id`

## Evolving the app

Evolving the application typically requires three steps:

1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate
1. Update your server-side application code
1. Build new UI features in React

For the following example scenario, assume you want to add a "profile" feature to the app where users can create a profile and write a short bio about themselves.

### 1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate

The first step is to add a new table, e.g. called `Profile`, to the database. You can do this by adding a new model to your [Prisma schema file](./prisma/schema.prisma) file and then running a migration afterwards:

```diff
// schema.prisma

model Post {
  id        Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}

model User {
  id      Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id 
  name    String? 
  email   String   @unique
  post    Post[]
+ profile Profile?
}

+model Profile {
+  id     Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
+  bio    String?
+  userId Int     @unique
+  user   User    @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
+}
```

Once you've updated your data model, you can execute the changes against your database with the following command:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 2. Update your application code

You can now use your `PrismaClient` instance to perform operations against the new `Profile` table. Here are some examples:

#### Create a new profile for an existing user

```ts
const profile = await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    bio: "Hello World",
    user: {
      connect: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Create a new user with a new profile

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: "john@prisma.io",
    name: "John",
    profile: {
      create: {
        bio: "Hello World",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Update the profile of an existing user

```ts
const userWithUpdatedProfile = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
  data: {
    profile: {
      update: {
        bio: "Hello Friends",
      },
    },
  },
});
```


### 3. Build new UI features in React

Once you have added a new endpoint to the API (e.g. `/api/profile` with `/POST`, `/PUT` and `GET` operations), you can start building a new UI component in React. It could e.g. be called `profile.tsx` and would be located in the `pages` directory.

In the application code, you can access the new endpoint via `fetch` operations and populate the UI with the data you receive from the API calls.
