# Subscriptions Apollo Server + Nexus

This example shows how to implement a **Subscriptions in TypeScript** based on  [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client), [apollo-server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) and [Nexus Schema](https://www.nexusjs.org/#/guides/schema). It is based on a SQLite database, you can find the database file with some dummy data at [`./prisma/dev.db`](./prisma/dev.db).

## How to use

### 1. Download example & install dependencies

Download this example:

```
curl https://codeload.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tar.gz/latest | tar -xz --strip=2 prisma-examples-latest/typescript/subscriptions-pubsub
```

Install npm dependencies:
```
cd subscriptions-pubsub
npm install
```

Note that this also generates Prisma Client JS into `node_modules/@prisma/client` via a `postinstall` hook of the `@prisma/client` package from your `package.json`.

### 2. Start the GraphQL server

Launch your GraphQL server with this command:

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).

## Using the GraphQL API

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`./schema.graphql`](./schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

### Call the subscription and watch for it in the GraphQL Playground

```graphql
subscription latestPost {
  latestPost {
    title
    content
  }
}
```

This will listen whenever you create a new draft as follows:

### Create a new draft

```graphql
mutation {
  createDraft(
    title: "Join the Prisma Slack"
    content: "https://slack.prisma.io"
    authorEmail: "alice@prisma.io"
  ) {
    id
    published
  }
}
```

Running the above mutation will automatically send the created data to the subscription!

### For viewing it best

- Keep two tabs of the GraphQL Playground open side by side.
- Run the subscription in one tab.
- Fire the mutation in the other tab and view results in the subscriptions tab in real-time!

## Evolving the app

Evolving the application typically requires two steps:

1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate
1. Update your application code

For the following example scenario, assume you want to add a "profile" feature to the app where users can create a profile and write a short bio about themselves.

### 1. Migrate your database using Prisma Migrate

The first step is to add a new table, e.g. called `Profile`, to the database. You can do this by adding a new model to your [Prisma schema file](./prisma/schema.prisma) file and then running a migration afterwards:

```diff
// schema.prisma
model Post {
  id        Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
  title     String
  content   String?
  published Boolean @default(false)
  author    User?   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
}

model User {
  id      Int      @default(autoincrement()) @id 
  name    String? 
  email   String   @unique
  post    Post[]
+ profile Profile?
}

+model Profile {
+  id     Int     @default(autoincrement()) @id
+  bio    String?
+  userId Int     @unique
+  user   User    @relation(fields: [user], references: [id])
+}
```

Once you've updated your data model, you can execute the changes against your database with the following command:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 2. Update your application code

You can now use your `PrismaClient` instance to perform operations against the new `Profile` table. Those operations can be used to implement queries and mutations in the GraphQL API.

#### Option A: Expose `Profile` operations via `nexus-prisma`

With the `nexus-prisma` package, you can expose the new `Profile` model in the API like so:

```diff
// ... as before

const User = objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id()
    t.model.name()
    t.model.email()
    t.model.posts({
      pagination: false,
    })
+   t.model.profile()
  },
})

// ... as before

+const Profile = objectType({
+  name: 'Profile',
+  definition(t) {
+    t.model.id()
+    t.model.bio()
+    t.model.user()
+  },
+})

// ... as before

export const schema = makeSchema({
+  types: [Query, Mutation, Post, User, Profile],
  // ... as before
}
```

#### Option B: Use the `PrismaClient` instance directly

As the Prisma Client API was updated, you can now also invoke "raw" operations via `prisma.profile` directly.

##### Create a new profile for an existing user

```ts
const profile = await prisma.profile.create({
  data: {
    bio: "Hello World",
    user: {
      connect: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
    },
  },
});
```

##### Create a new user with a new profile

```ts
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: "john@prisma.io",
    name: "John",
    profile: {
      create: {
        bio: "Hello World",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

##### Update the profile of an existing user

```ts
const userWithUpdatedProfile = await prisma.user.update({
  where: { email: "alice@prisma.io" },
  data: {
    profile: {
      update: {
        bio: "Hello Friends",
      },
    },
  },
});
```
